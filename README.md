This project focuses on ensuring privacy in financial services through secure processing of sensitive data. We created a loan approval classifier using homomorphic encryption. It allows computations on encrypted data while keeping it secure throughout the process

## Tech stack
- **Used dataset:** [Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalisingh1411/loan-approval-prediction?resource=download&select=Training+Dataset.csv)
- **Classification Model:** Logistic regression model to determine loan approvals based on clients' personal information.
- **Encryption Library**: [pi-HEaaN](https://pypi.org/project/pi-heaan/0.4.2/)
- **Web framework**: Flask 
- **Data Preprocessing**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn

## Conclusions & Limitations
- The accuracy of the model using homomorphic encryption is comparable to that of the standard model, providing similar performance with enhanced security.
- However, the training time for the model with homomorphic encryption is significantly longer than that of the standard model.
