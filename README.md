# **Loan Approval Classifier Using Homomorphic Encryption**



![System Architecture Diagram](path/to/architecture-diagram.png)  
*An overview of the system's components and data flow.*

## **Overview**  
A **loan approval classifier** that ensures data privacy using **homomorphic encryption**. This project processes sensitive personal data securely by performing computations directly on encrypted information without decryption.

---

## **Motivation**  
This project addresses the growing need for secure handling of sensitive financial data in loan approval processes. By leveraging homomorphic encryption, it ensures privacy without compromising functionality.

---

## **Why Homomorphic Encryption?**  
Homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during processing. It strikes a perfect balance between **security** and **functionality**, making it ideal for applications like **loan approval systems** where privacy is critical.
